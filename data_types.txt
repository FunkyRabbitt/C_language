3. fopen() --> helps to open the FILE
    syntax= fopen("name of FILE","mode of open")
4. fputc() --> put the character in the FILE
    syntax = fputc(name[counter],variable)
    variable = store the value of the file with method of opening
5. gets() --> helps to store the long value with space also
    syntax = gets(name)
6. fputs --> helps to write the whole string at a time in the FILE and only take the data from gets() function
    syntax = fputs(name,variable)
7. fprintf() --> helps to put the value in the file with different data types at the same time and write the data in the formatted way
    syntax = fprints(variable,"value",value_variable)
    value = "%s"
    value_variable =name[] -- this means the variable where the string is stored
