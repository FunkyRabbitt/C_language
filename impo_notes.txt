=======FILE HANDLING START========

1. FILE --> helps to create the FILE
2. *name_of_variable --> creating the variable to open the FILE
3. fopen() --> helps to open the FILE
    syntax= fopen("name of FILE","mode of open")
4. fputc() --> put the character in the FILE
    syntax = fputc(name[counter],variable)
    variable = store the value of the file with method of opening
5. gets() --> helps to store the long value with space also
    syntax = gets(variable)
6. fputs --> helps to write the whole string at a time in the FILE and only take the data from gets() function
    syntax = fputs(variable,file_Pointer)
7. fprintf() --> helps to put the value in the file with different data types at the same time and write the data in the formatted way
    syntax = fprints(file_Pointer,"value",variable)
    value = "%s"
    variable =name[] -- this means the variable where the string is stored
8. feof --> check the end of the file
    syntax = feof(file_Pointer)
9. fgetc() --> read the character from the file
    syntax =fgets(file_Pointer)
10. fscanf() --> read the data from the file only the first open(only read the first word from the file)[word or character]
    syntax = fscanf(file_Pointer,value,variable to store the data)
11. fgets() --> gets the string from the file
    syntax = fgets(variable_to_store,length,file_Pointer)

========END OF FILE HANDLING==============

======== STRING FUNCTION===================

1. strcpy() --> helps to copy the string one from another
    syntax = strcpy(target,source)
    target = kasma copy garne
    source = ko bata copy garne
2. strcat() --> used to add the two string(concating the string)
    syntax = strcat(target,source)
3. strlen() --> helps to find the length of the word or string
    strlen(word)
